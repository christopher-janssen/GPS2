# Can Location Patterns Predict Substance Use Lapses?

## Research Context

**Our lab develops predictive models for substance use recovery**

Machine learning to forecast high-risk moments

-   Enable just-in-time interventions
-   Personalize support strategies
-   Improve recovery outcomes

::: {.callout-warning .fragment}
## Key Question:

What signals predict lapse risk?
:::

## Current Gold Standard:

**Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)**

4x daily surveys capturing real-time psychological state:

::: nonincremental
-   Cravings and urges

-   Stress and mood

-   Confidence in resisting

-   Recent trigger exposure
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
## Result:

We can reliably predict *when* someone is at high risk
:::

## Understanding the "Why?"

Prediction alone isn't enough for intervention

We need diverse explanatory information:

::: incremental
-   What contexts trigger lapses?

-   Which behaviors are protective

-   What patterns precede high-risk moments?
:::

::: {.callout-important .fragment}
## Problem:

Can't expand EMA surveys (already high-burden)
:::

# How do we increase explanatory power without increasing burden?

## Passive Sensing Through GPS

People only visit \~30 places regularly

-   Manageable to characterize
-   Stable enough to extract patterns
-   Rich contextual potential

## Raw GPS Isn't Enough

A typical GPS dataframe looks like:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tibble)

tibble(
  subid = c("1", "1", "12", "12"),
  lat = c(43.0731, 43.0745, 43.0689, 43.0821),
  lon = c(-89.4012, -89.3998, -89.4156, -89.3742),
  time = c("08:23:14", "12:45:32", "18:12:09", "14:33:21")
    )
```

These can be marginally useful, but we need a way to contextualize the significance of a place to an individuals recovery

## Current Approach: Active Contextualization

**Ask participants to describe their main locations**

For locations that participants visited more than 2x a month:

-   Identify the location (home/work/etc)
-   Report availability of alcohol
-   Categorize it as "helpful" or "harmful" for their recovery

## Current Approach: Active Contextualization

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Advantages:

-   High specificity

-   Captures personal context
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
Disadvantages:

-   Adds additional participant burden

-   Only feasible for main locations
:::
::::::

## GPS2: Public Data Enrichment

By joining GPS points with public reference data-sets, new levels of analyses become available:

-   **Points of Interests**: Proximity to bars, clinics, parks
-   **Land use patterns**: Residential, commercial, recreational
-   **Neighborhood characteristics**: ADI, greenspace

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
## But importantly:

No added participant burden!
:::

## Planned Analyses:

Passive XGBoost(?) Modessl

Model Comparison: Passive vs Active Model

## Limitations

-   Mismatched temporal data
-   Quality issues involving GPS data collection during study

## Next Steps:

-   Expand to environmental risk factors
-   Test interactions with time and demographics
-   Add additional sources of public data.
