# POI organization decisions

## High relevance

### Risky

- On-premise alcohol outlets (bars, pubs, nightclubs, etc)
- Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores with alcohol)

### Protective

- Recovery housing / treatment facilities (sober living homes, residential treatment outpatient clinics) (could augment with SAHMSA?)
- Healthcare facilities (hospitals, primary care, mental health)

## Medium relevance

### Risky

- Restaurants with alcohol service, late-night morphing, perhaps look to licensing data?
- Retail and commercial areas (general retail, shopping centers?)

### Protective

- Social and community services (community centers, religious institutions, social service organizations)
- Parks and recreational facilities (parks, sports centers, gyms, playgrounds)

## Noise

- Infrastructure and utilities (trash cans, benches, fire hydrants, utility poles, manholes)
- Parking facilities (parking lots, garages, and spaces)
- Minor infrastructure (fountains, surveillance cameras, street lamps, mailboxes)
- Vague or empty POI
- Rare categories?

### Boundary Cases

- Cafes and coffee shops?
- Grocery stores and supermarkets?
- Hotels and lodging?
