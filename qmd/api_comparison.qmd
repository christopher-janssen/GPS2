## Key Concepts + Vocabulary

### What is a POI (Point of Interest)

A **point of interest** is any specific location that someone might find useful or interesting. For this specific use case, our POIs include:

-   **Risk locations**: Bars, liquor stores, nightclubs
-   **Support locations**: Hospitals, treatment centers, AA meetings
-   **Routine locations**: Work, home, church, gym

### Key Terms

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a service that lets your computer program automatically request information from another company's database.

**Geocoding**: Converting addresses to GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)

**Reverse Geocoding**: Converting GPS coordinates to addresses or place names

**Batch Processing**: Sending multiple requests at once or processing stored data all together (possible with the already collected GPS data)

### Preprocessing Steps to Look Into:

1.  De-duplication
2.  Clustering nearby points
3.  Potentially focusing API calls on high-risk times or important locations?

## Google Maps ([Effective March 2025](https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/?utm_experiment=13102542))

-   10,000 Geocoding (or Reverse Geocoding) API requests per month free
-   10,000 Places API requests per month free
    -   provides "place search" (find all "x" locations nearby)
    -   place "details"(business hours, ratings, phone \#'s, price level, photos)
    -   place autocomplete (not relevant)

### What counts as a request?

-   Each GPS coordinate lookup = 1 request
-   Each request for place details = 1 request

### Costs past free tier?

-   Geocoding: \$5 per 1,000 additional requests
-   Places: \$17 per 1,000 additional requests

### Rate Limits:

-   50 req/second (3,000/minute)

-   can be increased by requesting a quota increase

### Strengths

1.  **Exceptional Alcohol Venue Detection**
    -   Identifies bars with high accuracy
    -   Distinguishes between bar, nightclub, pub categories
    -   Includes liquor stores with `liquor_store` type
    -   Shows real-time hours and busy times
2.  **Rich Business Information**
    -   Operating hours (potential for time-based risk assessment?)
    -   User ratings and review count (venue popularity metric?)
    -   Price levels (socioeconomic indicators?)
    -   Photos (possible image analysis down the road)

### **Limitations**

-   Cannot identify restaurants serving alcohol
-   Restaurants are labeled generically
    -   No flag for alcohol service
    -   Major gap for recovery research
-   High cost for larger or RTS studies
-   Low Data Storage amount and flexibility

## OpenStreetMap Services

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project where volunteers worldwide contribute geographic data. It offers several free services:

### Nominatim - Reverse Geocoding Service

**What it does**: Converts GPS coordinates to addresses and place names using OpenStreetMap data.

**Pricing**:

-   Completely free
-   No API key required
-   Must follow usage policy

[**Rate Limits on Public Server**:](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)

-   **Absolute maximum**: 1 request per second
-   **Daily theoretical max**: 86,400 requests (if running 24/7)
-   **Required**: User-Agent header identifying your application
-   **Prohibited**: Bulk processing, commercial use on public servers

#### **Strengths**:

1.  **Completely free** with no registration
2.  **Global coverage** (quality varies by region)
3.  **Flexible querying** - can search by name, address, or coordinates
4.  **Self-hosting option** - run your own server with no limits

#### **Limitations**:

1.  **Data quality varies** - depends on local volunteer activity
2.  **Less business metadata** - may not have hours, phone numbers
3.  **Slower processing** - rate limits mean 24+ hours for large datasets
