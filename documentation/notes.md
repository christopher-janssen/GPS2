# GPS22 Development Notes & Planning

## Work in Progress

### Fix

- [ ] **Quality Filtering Validation**: Test ">30min & >0.31mi" rule - may remove valid long visits with GPS drift
- [ ] **Daily Clustering Boundary**: Fix midnight splits for 24-hour locations (hospitals, night shifts) 
- [ ] **Minimum Points Requirement**: Validate 2-point cluster minimum vs single-point long visits with sparse GPS

### Build

- [ ] **Spatial Clustering Validation**: Implement silhouette analysis to optimize 20m radius
- [ ] **Duration Calculation**: Replace time span (max-min) with actual presence time estimation
- [ ] **Cross-Day Location Merging**: Add temporal patterns to distance-based aggregation logic


## Development Log

### 7/1/2025

#### Initial Setup & Stationarity Detection

- ‚úÖ Made robust data access script 
- ‚úÖ Established traveling vs stationary distinction (time derivative ref)
- ~~Abandoned k-means clustering approach~~

### 7/3/2025

#### Clustering Algorithm Research

- Investigated alternative clustering over k-means: DBSCAN and `fpc` package in R
- Read Claire's papers and DBSCAN research

### 7/6/2025

#### Stationary Point Validation

- Created script to view stationary points for validation
- Prepared visualizations for team discussion on stationarity accuracy

### 7/7/2025

#### Visualization Development

- Created downloadable Leaflet maps for team meeting

### 7/8/2025

#### Clustering Strategy Pivot

- **Decision**: Use more liberal stationary definitions (patterns split across days)
- **New Approach**: Create clusters across DAYS rather than total datasets 
- **Methods**: Both DBSCAN and K-MEANS with defined radius thresholds
- Focus on creating maps that demonstrate this approach

### 7/11/2025

#### Daily Visualization Success

- ‚úÖ Successfully implemented daily visualizations with improved readability
- ‚úÖ Consolidated scripts for cleanliness and workflow efficiency
- **Next**: Move towards clustering implementation
- Considered visualizing both own data and Claire's data for accuracy validation

### 7/13/2025

#### Workflow Consolidation

- üéâ **Major Documentation Win**: Consolidated workflows into clean QMD scripts
- ‚úÖ Created first-attempt clustering script
- ‚úÖ Fixed time_derivative calculations and mapping demos
- **Focus**: Need to implement day-to-day clustering for better real-world use cases

### 7/15/2025

#### Time-Duration Modified DBSCAN Research

- **Goal**: Better identify USEFUL points, filter out transit stops (bus stops, traffic lights)
- **Research**: Paper sent to Claire on time-duration DBSCAN modifications
- **Caching Strategy**: Researching sustainable caching for large-scale POI queries across multiple participants
- **Performance**: Considering Julia/C integration for computational efficiency

### 7/16/2025

#### Algorithm Pivot: Abandon DBSCAN

- ‚ùå **DBSCAN abandoned**: Doesn't work well with our GPS data collection techniques
- ‚úÖ **New Approach**: Time/duration based clustering methods showing promising results
- **Performance Research**: GPS POI caching proposal using grid-based hierarchical methods
- **Tech Exploration**: Considering Julia implementation for performance

### 7/17/2025

#### Caching Strategy Decision

- **Meeting Outcome**: Even un-optimized caching system sufficient for OSM daily rate limits
- **Research**: Function decorators (Adam's suggestion) for caching implementation
- **Next**: Develop POI querying system linking with known location information

### 8/3/2025

#### Infrastructure Breakthrough: PostGIS + Docker

- üéâ **Major Infrastructure Win**: Privacy-compliant GPS analysis system operational
- ‚úÖ Built Docker container with PostgreSQL + PostGIS spatial extensions
- ‚úÖ Created `postgis_connection.R` with comprehensive database connection/testing
- ‚úÖ Verified all spatial operations: distance calculations, coordinate extraction, indexing
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested with Madison WI locations (downtown, campus, capitol)
- ‚úÖ Established robust R ‚Üî PostGIS bridge for GPS data integration
- **Next**: Migrate CSV-based workflows into secure local database for API caching

### 8/7/2025

#### Major Project Organization Overhaul

- üöÄ **Organization Win**: Comprehensive function organization and workflow setup
- ‚úÖ Added detailed usage and setup guide for project onboarding
- ‚úÖ Updated/cleaned sample data for tutorials
- ‚úÖ Deleted obsolete QMD files, moved API documentation to proper folder structure
- ‚úÖ Updated file paths in `gps2_guide.qmd` for new organization

### 8/13/2025

- ‚úÖ Improved analysis script performance and readability

### 8/22/2025

#### Code Organization & Utils

- ‚úÖ Added `/utils` folder to modularize functions and clean up main scripts
- **Impact**: Significantly shortened main analysis scripts, improved maintainability

### 8/25/2025

#### Tidyverse Compliance Update

- ‚úÖ Updated entire codebase for tidyverse compliance and best practices
- **Impact**: Improved code readability and R community standard adherence

### 8/26/2025

#### Security, Testing & Documentation

- Comprehensive function validity and security testing
- Created testing scripts and documentation (moved to archive after completion)
- Updated Docker YAML with environment path configuration
- Created `.env` file for robust, OS-based filepath handling
- Updated all documentation to reflect code changes
- Improved package loading to lab/tidyverse best practices
- Updated function documentation to Roxygen standards (preparing for eventual package creation)

### 8/27/2025

#### Repository Overhaul & QMD Workflow Architecture
