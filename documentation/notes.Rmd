# Notes

## 7/1/2025

to do:

-   make robust data access script [DONE]
-   establish traveling vs stationary distinction (time derivative ref) [DONE]
-   ~~make clustering script~~


## 7/3/2025

-  Look into alternative clustering over k-means or k-means ++, particularly DBSCAN and `fpc` package in R
-  read claire papers / dbscan papers


## 7/6/2025

- made script to view stationary points, bring this to discuss whether or not the stationary script is working well, then talk about clustering


## 7/7/2025

- made downloaded leaflet maps for meeting tomorrow


## 7/8/2025

- go with more liberal stationary definitions, as these patterns are split across days
- create clusters across DAYS rather than total datasets for both DBSCAN and K-MEANS
- decide a radius for establishing clusters
- create maps that show this

## 7/11/2025

- success on the daily visualizations, improved readability + combined scripts for cleanliness
- move towards clustering
- visualize own and claire data for accuracy?

## 7/13/2025

- consolidated workflows into QMD scripts that are much neater, cleaner, and easy to follow. Big documentation win today
- make a first-attempt at a clustering script, need to move to day to day for better use-case
- fixed time_derivative and mapping demos

## 7/15/2025

- looking to time-duration modified DBSCAN algorithm, doing this to better identify USEFUL points, and filter out things like stops for bus transits, and other superfluous stops
- for this, looking into paper sent to Claire
- research how caching for large amount of places across multiple people across multiple points could be done sustainably. (might finally get to work with julia/c ?????)


## 7/16/2025

- ditched DBSCAN entirely as it sucks given our data collection techniques, moved to time/duration based clustering methods, promising results as of right now
- GPS POI caching proposal. perhaps grid-based hierarchical methods. JULIA ANGLE

## 7/17/2025

- following meeting, even an un-optimized caching system will likely be enough to match with the daily rate limits of OSM (we can go do it anyways )
- check out function decorators that Adam mentioned for caching.
- need to develop the POI querying, can link it with known information.

## 8/3/2025

- set up PostGIS + Docker infrastructure for privacy-compliant GPS analysis
- built Docker container with PostgreSQL + PostGIS spatial extensions running locally 
- created `postgis_connection.R` script with comprehensive database connection and testing functions
- verified all spatial operations working: distance calculations, coordinate extraction, indexing
- successfully tested with Madison WI test data (downtown, campus, capitol locations)
- established R â†” PostGIS bridge for future GPS data integration
- next: move CSV-based analysis workflows into secure local database for API caching system

## 8/7/2025

- huge organization overhaul, verified new function organization and workflow setup
- added usage and setup guide for project
- updated/cleaned sample data for tutorial 
- deleted old QMD files, moved api_documentation to documentation folder
- update file paths in gps2_guide.qmd

## 8/13/2025

- added zoning_operations.R and added zoning visualizations

## 8/19/2025

- improved visualization functions and display
- similar improvement to analysis script

## 8/22/2025

- added /utils folder to shorten functions + clean scripts

## 8/25/2025

- updated code for tidyverse compliance

## 8/26/2025

- tested function validity and security, moved testing scripts to archive
- added testing scripts + documentation --> moved to archive
- updated docker yaml to receive an environment path that can be set through also newly created env file for handling of robust filepath naming that is OS based
- updated documentation to reflect updated code
- updated package loading to be lab/tidyverse best practices
- updated function documentation to roxygen standards (eventual package creation?)
