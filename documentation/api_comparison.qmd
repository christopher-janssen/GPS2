## Key Concepts + Vocabulary

### What is a POI (Point of Interest)

A **point of interest** is any specific location that someone might find useful or interesting. For this specific use case, our POIs include:

-   **Risk locations**: Bars, liquor stores, nightclubs
-   **Support locations**: Hospitals, treatment centers, AA meetings
-   **Routine locations**: Work, home, church, gym

### Key Terms

**API**: an [Application Programming Interface]{.underline} is a service that lets your computer program automatically request information from another company's database.

**Geocoding**: Converting addresses to GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)

**Reverse Geocoding**: Converting GPS coordinates to addresses or place names

**Batch Processing**: Sending multiple requests at once or processing stored data all together (possible with the already collected GPS data)

### Preprocessing Steps to Look Into:

1.  De-duplication
2.  Clustering nearby points
3.  Potentially focusing API calls on high-risk times or important locations?

## Google Maps ([Effective March 2025](https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/?utm_experiment=13102542))

-   10,000 Geocoding (or Reverse Geocoding) API requests per month free
-   10,000 Places API requests per month free
    -   provides "place search" (find all "x" locations nearby)
    -   place "details"(business hours, ratings, phone \#'s, price level, photos)
    -   place autocomplete (not relevant)

### What counts as a request?

-   Each GPS coordinate lookup = 1 request
-   Each request for place details = 1 request

### Costs past free tier?

-   Geocoding: \$5 per 1,000 additional requests
-   Places: \$17 per 1,000 additional requests

### **Rate Limits**:

-   50 req/second (3,000/minute)

-   can be increased by requesting a quota increase

### Strengths

1.  **Exceptional Alcohol Venue Detection**
    -   Identifies bars with high accuracy
    -   Distinguishes between bar, nightclub, pub categories
    -   Includes liquor stores with `liquor_store` type
    -   Shows real-time hours and busy times
2.  **Rich Business Information**
    -   Operating hours (potential for time-based risk assessment?)
    -   User ratings and review count (venue popularity metric?)
    -   Price levels (socioeconomic indicators?)
    -   Photos (possible image analysis down the road)

### **Limitations**

-   Cannot identify restaurants serving alcohol
-   Restaurants are labeled generically
    -   No flag for alcohol service
    -   Major gap for recovery research
-   High cost for larger or RTS studies
-   Low Data Storage amount and flexibility

## OpenStreetMap Services

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project where volunteers worldwide contribute geographic data. It offers several free services:

### Nominatim - Reverse Geocoding Service

**What it does**: Converts GPS coordinates to addresses and place names using OpenStreetMap data.

**Pricing**:

-   Completely free
-   No API key required
-   Must follow usage policy

[**Rate Limits on Public Server**:](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)

-   **Absolute maximum**: 1 request per second
-   **Daily theoretical max**: 86,400 requests (if running 24/7)
-   **Required**: User-Agent header identifying your application
-   **Prohibited**: Bulk processing, commercial use on public servers

#### **Strengths**:

1.  **Completely free** with no registration
2.  **Global coverage** (quality varies by region)
3.  **Flexible querying** - can search by name, address, or coordinates
4.  **Self-hosting option** - run your own server with no limits

#### **Limitations**:

1.  **Data quality varies** - depends on local volunteer activity
2.  **Less business metadata** - may not have hours, phone numbers
3.  **Slower processing** - rate limits mean 24+ hours for large data sets

#### Related - OpenStreetMap Tags

OSM uses a tagging system to categorize places.

[**Alcohol-Related Venues**](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features)**:**

-   `amenity = bar` - Establishments focused on drinking
-   `amenity = pub` - British/Irish style pubs (often serve food)
-   `amenity = nightclub` - Dance clubs, late-night venues
-   `shop = alcohol` - Liquor stores, off-licenses
-   `amenity = restaurant` + `drink:wine = yes` - Restaurants serving alcohol (when tagged)

### Overpass API

Search tool that works with the OSM database for complex search capabilities, similar to the google maps "place search" functionality

### **Rate Limits**:

-   No fixed rate limit
-   Uses "slot" system - limited concurrent queries
-   Large queries may be rejected during busy times

### [Location IQ](https://locationiq.com/pricing)

**What it is:** A commercial service built on OpenStreetMap data with added enhancements and better infrastructure.

#### Free Tier Details:

-   5,000 requests per day (not per month)
-   2 requests per second rate limit
-   Includes geocoding and reverse geocoding

#### Strengths

1.  **Daily limits reset** - Unlike monthly limits, you get fresh quota each day
2.  **Allows caching** - You can store results permanently
3.  **Better infrastructure** - likely more reliable than public Nominatim

#### Limitations:

1.  Likely would need to heavily deduplicate / cluster points to utilize efficiently

## Government APIs

[Official US government service](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/complete-technical-documentation/census-geocoder.html) for converting addresses to coordinates and census geography.

### **Strengths:**

-   Completely unlimited - no rate limits published
-   Batch processing - can send up to 10,000 addresses at once
-   No registration required for basic use
-   Returns census tract/block data for demographic analysis

### **Limitations:**

-   US addresses only
-   No business/POI information
-   Just address standardization and coordinates

### **Potential Use-Case:**

1.  First pass: Geocode all locations with Census API (free, unlimited)
2.  Second pass: Use commercial APIs only for venue identification

# Proposed Hybrid Approach:

### Tier 1: Bulk Processing (Free)

-   US Census API for geocoding
-   Overpass API for POI extraction
-   Process 99% of locations

### Tier 2: Verification/High Impact (Sparse Google Use)

**For the 1% of locations that are:**

-   Frequently visited
-   Potential risk venues
-   Visited during high-risk times
-   Ambiguous in OSM data
