# Notes

## 7/1/2025

to do:

-   make robust data access script [DONE]
-   establish traveling vs stationary distinction (time derivative ref) [DONE]
-   ~~make clustering script~~


## 7/3/2025

-  Look into alternative clustering over k-means or k-means ++, particularly DBSCAN and `fpc` package in R
-  read claire papers / dbscan papers


## 7/6/2025

- made script to view stationary points, bring this to discuss whether or not the stationary script is working well, then talk about clustering


## 7/7/2025

- made downloaded leaflet maps for meeting tomorrow


## 7/8/2025

- go with more liberal stationary definitions, as these patterns are split across days
- create clusters across DAYS rather than total datasets for both DBSCAN and K-MEANS
- decide a radius for establishing clusters
- create maps that show this

## 7/11/2025

- success on the daily visualizations, improved readability + combined scripts for cleanliness
- move towards clustering
- visualize own and claire data for accuracy?
